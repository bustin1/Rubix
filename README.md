# Rubix
A very real look alike of a 3x3 3D rubik's cube. 

# Description
Have you ever wanted to play with a rubik's cube but didn't actually have access to one physically? Well this is for you. Introductin my rubik's built from pyglet. Please NOTE: If you try to change the dimensions, the you will only be able to move the 1st and 3rd layers. There are no middle moves. And the program is a little slower.
